# Shortly-deploy

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor Remote Beta. This project was worked on with a pair. Using Angularjs we created a web app that would shorten and store a hyperlinks for users. This web app was deployed to heroku using Grunt.js which handled  compilation, concatenation, and minification of files.
