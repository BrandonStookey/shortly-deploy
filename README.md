# Shortly-deploy

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor Remote Beta. This project was worked on with a pair. Shortly is a URL shortener service similar to Bitly. This web app was deployed to heroku using Grunt.js which handled compilation, concatenation, and minification of files.
